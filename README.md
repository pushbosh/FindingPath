We aim to develop a Flask-based web application for finding the shortest path between two points using the A* algorithm. The platform will allow users to input start and end locations on an interactive map. The system will visualize the optimal route in real-time, leveraging A* for its efficiency in pathfinding. The application will include features like distance calculation, step-by-step navigation, and performance visualization of the algorithm. Designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, this tool can serve as a foundation for more advanced mapping services, integrating scalability and adaptability for future enhancements.
